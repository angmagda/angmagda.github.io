<!--First site begins here-->
			<h3>PINTEREST</h3>

			<p>When you're browsing online and see something you like, what do you do? Print it out? Take a screenshot and save it? I used to bookmark it on my computer, but to be honest, a few times went back to my bookmarks folder and actually did something. <a href="http://www.pinterest.com">Pinterest</a> answers this question by compiling all the great things you find online with a click. You just hit the "Pin it" button. That's it.</br>
			The main visual challenge that I find, is that it has to display lots of "pins" in such a way that the user finds it both attractive and interesting, according to his/her particular interests. Another challenge is how to organize all the "pins" so the user can access easily to all of them.
			</p>
<!--Second site begins here-->
			<h3>LDS</h3>

			<p>This site meets two main needs. First, the user to find all the available resources to give a Sunday school class, a talk, to find inspiring music, activities for Family Home Evenings, etc. Second, to find the closest lds church or Temple to where the user is (either visiting someone, on vacations, or just moved to another city). </br>
			The visual challenge it faces is to display the most recent and popular content in an elegant, simple, inspiring way.
			</p>
<!--Third site begins here-->
			<h3>COLOURLOVERS</h3>
			<img src="http://imgur.com/mKPZeQw"/>
			<p><a href="http://www.colourlovers.com">Colourlovers</a> answers the following questions: "What color palette could I use in my new project?", "Which are the new color trends?", "How can I share my color ideas?". </br>
			It's visual challenge is to convince the user since the beginning that he/she can actually find what he/she is looking for. Since color is their area of expertise should be colorful, harmonious, and showing the latest trends.
