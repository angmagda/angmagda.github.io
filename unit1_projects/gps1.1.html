    <h3 id = "text">Driver vs Navigator</h3>
      <p>
        You have two different people working together. First, you have the driver who writes all of the code. Secondly, you have a navigator who guides his or her partner. If you were driving a car, a driver would be on the gas pedal while the navigator would be steering.

    <h3 id ="text"> Why You Think Pair-Programming is Important to DBC</h3>
    <p>
       In DBC, there is a wide range of skills and expertise. There are some experienced programmers and some inexperienced programmers. Peer programming gives both people opportunities to learn. The experienced programmer can learn how to communicate their thought process while the inexperienced programmer can better their technical skills. In addition, peer programming teaches you how to work on a team.

     <h3 id ="text">What was it like to pair for the first time?</h3>
    <p>
      It's a totally different experience! At the beginning I was really nervous and couldn't understand what she was saying, but she was really kind and repeated everything I didn't get. I really enjoyed pairing for the first time. I'm sure that with the time is going to be easier and more comfortable.</br>
      It worked that we were communicating a lot expressing our ideas, doubts, etc. What I think that didn't work was sticking to our driver/navigator roles.
