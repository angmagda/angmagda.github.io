<!--My plan is to have a simple, clean website, with a dark background and bright colors for the content.
First, I'll make the wireframe in Adobe Illustrator with a grid of 12 columns to help me layout my website's elements.
Then, I'll choose the color palette.
After that, I'll begin with the basic HTML and CSS coding.
Then, add more code little by little until I like what I see and it's working the way I want.
Finally, commiting and pushing the files to Github.-->
