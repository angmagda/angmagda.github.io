			<h2>Analysis of my three favorite websites</h2>
			<h3>Magda Ang</h3>
			<h4>May 16th, 2014</h4>
			<!--First website analysis-->
			<p>Ok, so let's start with #3...</p>
			<a href="http://www.colourlovers.com"><h3>COLOURlovers</h3></a>
			<p align=left><a href="http://www.colourlovers.com"><img src="../images/colourlovers.jpg"/></a></p>
			<p><a href="http://www.colourlovers.com">Colourlovers</a> is a creative community where you can create & share color inspiration. I love colors! But when it comes to color harmony, color context, color wheel, etc., what can I tell you? I know almost nothing. People create and share their colors, palettes, and patterns so you don't have to pull your hair out trying to guess if a color matches another one. </p>
			<p>When you visit the site, looks a bit crowded but it's not, as soon as you start looking for what you need is quite easy to find it. I would describe this website as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Clean</li>
				<li>Organized</li>
				<li>Colorful</li>
				<li>Serious</li>
				<li>Attractive</li>
			</ul>
			<p>People around the world create and share their designs, discuss the latest trends, explore articles, etc. When I am working on a project I like to spend some time looking for a color or palette that I really like. It's very simple to find what you're looking for. My impressions based on the content are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Shareable</li>
				<li>Practical</li>
				<li>Powerful</li>
				<li>Helpful</li>
				<li>Abundant</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It's not that easy to browse through all the content of the site. There's too much information, too many colors, that I've never looked at it all. After being a while I feel happy because a have a lot of color options for my projects! Woohooo!!</p>
			<!--Second website analysis-->
			<p>#2...</p>
			<a href="http://www.lds.org"><h3>LDS</h3></a>
			<p align=left><a href="http://www.lds.org"><img src="../images/lds.jpg"/></a></p>
			<p>I really thought it through about showing this website, it's not my intention to give a lecture about God, Jesus Christ, mormonism, etc. It really is one of my favorite websites and I spend a lot of time on it, reading articles, searching for interesting youth activities, or even watching lovely videos. It's inspiring and help me feel closer to my Heavenly Father.</p>
			<p>My impressions when I open the website are that it's:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Simple</li>
				<li>Pretty</li>
				<li>Readable</li>
				<li>Lively</li>
				<li>Vibrant</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This site's content is varied. From finding a church building in your city, to resorces you can use at Sunday School. There are inspirational messages, videos, stories, links to other lds websites, upcoming events, news, etc. Based on all these, I can describe it's content as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Inspiring</li>
				<li>Informative</li>
				<li>Loving</li>
				<li>Heartening</li>
				<li>Varied</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is easy to find what you're looking for. There are quick links to the most popular stuff and a very interesting article or message on the front page. I don't think is possible to browse through all the content, though.
			Most of the times I feel loved after reading a couple of messages and hopeful that everything is going to be alright.</p>
			<!--Third website analysis-->
			<p>#1...</p>
			<a href="http://www.pinterest.com"><h3>Pinterest</h3></a>
			<p align=left><a href="http://www.pinterest.com"><img src="../images/pinterest.jpg"/></a></p>
			<p>Whenever I have some spare time, or if I want a good chocolate cake recipe, or if I need some motivation to keep on training (any excuse is valid), I visit this site. It allows you to "pin" things online. When you see something you love and don't want to forget, you just save it or "pin" it on your "board" so you can access to it any time you want.</p>
			<p>Visually <a href="http://www.pinterest.com">Pinterest</a> is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Busy</li>
				<li>Organized</li>
				<li>Practical</li>
				<li>Cheerful</li>
				<li>Bright</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can follow people and people can follow you (like on Twitter), but the difference is that you can choose to follow all of a user's boards or just one. Pinterest shows you pins from the people you follow and others of course. You can easily "pin" things from other websites to your account, but what I do is search for something I need and when I find it, I "pin" it on my board. I think the content is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Helpful</li>
				<li>Descriptive</li>
				<li>Funny</li>
				<li>Generous</li>
				<li>Fresh</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are lots of categories you can search through. I can stay for hours looking at "pins" about animals, yoga, DIY's, etc., and commenting about them. I like to share "pins" with my mom, my sister, and my friends. If I see something they may love I just send it to them. At the end, I always feel curious, excited about a new DIY project, or challenged to cook a new recipe.</p>
