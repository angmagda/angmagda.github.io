			<h1>DEV BOOT <strong>WHAT?</strong></h1>

			<h2>My impression of DBC</h2>
			<h3>Magda Ang</h3>
			<h5><em>May 16th, 2014</em></h5>
			<p>Unlike many of my fellow boots, when I first heard "DevBootCamp" was really strange for me. In Mexico we don't have such things, not where I live anyway. So when my sister told me it would be a great opportunity to learn and to practice my English, my actual words were "Dev Boot what??" then she explained, sent some links, videos, etc. My answer was "Ok, I'll think about it". As soon as I started doing the research, my attitude changed and I thought "This is something I MUST do".</p>
			<p>My first impression of DBC is that is harder than I expected. I'm spending way more than the 20hrs/week  they said phase_0 would take. I believe my husband and kids are thinking about leaving me, hahaha, just kidding! But really, I need to organize myself better. </p>
			<p>So here I am, working hard, with lots of questions, worried about having the 'impostor syndrome', and nervous that my English skills may not be good enough to succeed. On the other hand, after watching Shereef's video I feel more confident. You don't get everybody looking and pointing at you if you don't understand something, questions are even expected at DBC! I must remember that and not be ashamed. I know I can do this! DBC is more than just a learn-Ruby-in-9-weeks program, it challenges you to develop that engineering sense, to be a better version of yourself, to be humble, to be happy. I definitely see myself engaged in this type of culture!</p>
			<p>Nervous? Yes. But I'm sure this is going to be one of the best experiences in my life. I'm looking forward to it!</p>
