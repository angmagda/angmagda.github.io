			<h2>JavaScript: Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>

			<h3>Why is it so popular in web development?</h3>
			<p>JavaScript is an object scripting language used to make web pages interactive. It's becoming really popular due to its ability to deliver rich, dynamic web content, its relatively lightweight and its high ease of use (really, I researched, that's what everybody says). It is an interpreted language, so no special program is required to create usable code. You just need a plain text editor (at DBC we use Sublime Text) for being able to write JavaScript.
			Do we need to learn it? Yes! According to <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/08/09/why-javascript-will-become-the-dominant-programming-language-of-the-enterprise#awesm=~oFHbO37UksAbr7">this article</a>, these are the factors that support the reasoning that JavaScript will become the dominant programming language:
			<ol>
				<li>Mobility & Client-Side Development</li>
				<li>Cloud & Server-Side Development</li>
				<li>Resources and Skill Sets</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Advantages</h3>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> - Javascript is relatively simple to learn and implement. Syntax is really close to English. It uses the DOM model that provides plenty of prewritten functionality to the various objects on pages making it easy to develop a script to solve a custom purpose.</li>
				<li><strong>Versatility</strong> - JavaScript plays nicely with other languages and can be used in a huge variety of applications. Developers can write snippets of Javascript which can execute on desired web pages to extend its functionality. JavaScript can be inserted into any web page regardless of the file extension.</li>
				<li><strong>Speed</strong> - Javascript is executed on the client side. What does client-side mean? Are scripts that execute in the user's browser, in the user's machine. This saves bandwidth on the web server. Since the code is executed in the user's computer, the result is completed almost instantly, depending on the task.</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Security</strong> - Because the code executes on the users' computer, in some cases it can be exploited for malicious purposes. Javascript snippets, once appended onto web pages execute on client servers immediately and therefore can also be used to exploit the user's system. This is one reason some people choose to disable JavaScript.</li>
				<li><strong>Inconsistency</strong> - JavaScript is sometimes interpreted differently by different browsers. This enrages developers all around the world. Don't be overly concerned by this though - as long as you test your script in all the major browsers you should be safe.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>My conclusion</h3>
				<p>There is a saying (at least in Mexico) that says "Clients are always right", let's give them what they want! Users now demand a great user experience, with websites and applications rich in content and responsive designs.
				I think is unquestionable to learn JavaScript or not, every person wishing to make a career in developing, must learn Javascript. I don't understand why some people hate JaveScript and consider it as a second-class citizen in the programming world, but their attitude is now changing towards it.
