			<h3>Concrete Sequential Thinking Style</h3>
			<p>As I was reading about my thinking style, I kept thinking "Yeah, that's me", but then I started reading other thinking styles characteristics and I found myself confused by the fact that I have a lot from other thinking styles, too. I even wondered if I had made a mistake in the test. I know that all of us have a little of each thinkink style but one is the strongest. I continued my research and I'm not sure if I'm Concrete Sequential or Concrete Random, but I'll stick to the test's result: Concrete Sequential. These are some Concrete Sequential thinking style characteristics:
			
			<ul>
				<li>Persistent and product oriented</li>
				<li>Strive for perfection and have an eye for detail</li>
				<li>Focus on material reality and physical objects</li>
				<li>One of the list-makers of the world</li>
				<li>Creativity lies not with originality but with making it more effective than the original</li>
				<li>Practical and well organized</li>
				<li>Thinking processes are logical, instinctive and deliberate</li>
				<li>Prefer an environment that is ordered, practical, quiet, and stable</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<h3>Strategies to Learn Better</h3>
			<p>This is my plan to be more efficient during phase 0.
				<ul>
					<li>Concrete Sequential thinkers work best when we have an orderly quiet environment. I can't work with my kids playing around, so I'll try to work only when they are sleeping or at school.</li>
					<li>I feel more comfortable when I know exactly what to do and how to do it. So far, DBC's instructions for phase 0 challenges are clear so I feel confident on what to do.</li>
					<li>I've been experimenting a lot to find answers, and I feel very good with the results. Even though is not part of my concrete sequential thinking style, I'll continue doing that.</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>What can I do to Expand the ways I Learn and Think?</h3>
			<p>For those with a growth mindset, “personal success is when you work your hardest to become your best,” this is so true. We are constantly changing, for good or for bad...why not change to become your best? It requires effort, work, perseverance, but we can do it.</br>
			When I started doing yoga, I looked at my teacher or pictures of people doing very complicated asanas (postures), and I thought I could never do that! But the body is so gentle, so wise, so flexible, that with love, constancy, and effort, now I can do asanas that I couldn't do before. There are many that I can't do yet, but some day I will...</br>
			We can apply the same principle to the mind. We need to change our attitude towards failure, and develop more passion for learning. Stretch our mind (like our body) to what we think is the limit, only to find out that each day we can go further.
